# speedsigns
CS5242 project on image classification (speed sign classification), done with Kenneth Goh.

The entire project was run on Google Colaboratory. This Github repository only contains the documentation. The notebook and data are too large and cannot be loaded onto Github, but if you wish to play with the data interactively, check out my Google Drive folder at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eu9yLoNLg7Wx_nYmbyInO2fj4fAj1c0h?usp=sharing.
